# Python Abstraction

# Note: There is no copy/paste information in this example

What is abstraction in a nutshell?

    Anywhere on the internet, you can find many explanation about abstraction. But I will explain in heremy understanding with the simplest explanation;

    1.) Group things which are similar.
    2.) Grab same functionality together.
    3.) Seperate individual properties.
    
Why do we need this?

    To prevent code complexity, better grabbing similar features together.

For example;

    Let's think that we sell 2 Devices; Laptop and Mobile
    
    Laptop has 5% tax amount and mobile has 8% tax amount.
    After these tax amount, they also have a common 3% tax amount.

        So we can group their commons together such as 3% and seperate their individual 
    tax prices into sub-classes/functions()

Let's check into the code.

Note = If no common functionality, so it is an Interface !
