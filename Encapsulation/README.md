# Python Encapsulation

# Note: There is no copy/paste information in this example

What is encapsulation in a nutshell?

        In Object Oriented Programming, sometimes we need to put some restrictions. 
    We may have some variable that we don't want to change its value but there is 
    possibility that we can change into the code by mistake.

With using Encapsulation, we can prevent this risk.

Usage:

        To have a 'private' variable or a function, we need to use double 
    underscores (__) such as "__pi_number" or "__welcome()".

Conclusion: Thus, we can only use these variable or functions into the class.

IMPORTANT HINT = Actually we can reach private variables or functions from out of class with;
    
    {instance}._{CLASSNAME}{VARIABLENAME or FUNCTION NAME}

But the point of encapsulation, preventing mistakes. So you already would not run a command like that.


I tried to explain with a simple code.
